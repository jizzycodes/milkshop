## Milkshop Backend Server

This folder contains the Express backend for the Milkshop brand site.

### Structure

- `config/` – database connection and configuration.
- `constants/` – single source of truth for lead CRM (stage, status, contact type, outcome).
- `controllers/` – request handlers containing business logic.
- `routes/` – Express routers that map URLs to controllers.
- `models/` – database access helpers (franchise_requests, franchise_leads, lead_contact_logs, admin).
- `middleware/` – reusable Express middleware (logging, errors, auth).
- `utils/` – small utility helpers (environment loading, JWT).
- `db/` – migrations and migration runner for franchise_leads CRM.
- `server.js` – application entrypoint.

### Phase 2 – Lead CRM (admin only)

- **Rule 1 (past due):** On `GET /api/admin/leads`, leads with `next_followup_at < now()` and status not DROPPED/ARCHIVED are auto-set to `FOR_FOLLOWUP`.
- **Rule 2 (contact log):** `POST /api/admin/leads/:id/contact-logs` updates the lead’s `last_contacted_at`, increments `followup_count`, and sets `next_followup_at` from the request body.
- **Rule 3 (stage):** Stage is updated only by managers via `PATCH /api/admin/leads/:id/stage` or `PATCH /api/admin/leads/:id`.

Endpoints: `GET/PATCH /api/admin/leads`, `GET/PATCH /api/admin/leads/:id`, `GET/POST /api/admin/leads/:id/contact-logs`.

### Phase 3 – Dashboard tabs (filter only, no extra tables)

`GET /api/admin/leads?tab=<tab>` – each tab is a simple filter on `franchise_leads`:

| Tab            | Filter                         | Order                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|
| `all`          | none                           | updated_at DESC       |
| `new`          | status = NEW                   | updated_at DESC       |
| `active`       | status = ACTIVE                | updated_at DESC       |
| `for_follow_up`| status = FOR_FOLLOWUP          | next_followup_at ASC   |
| `orientation`  | stage = ORIENTATION            | updated_at DESC       |
| `onboarding`   | stage = ONBOARDING             | updated_at DESC       |
| `dropped`      | status = DROPPED               | updated_at DESC       |
| `archived`     | status = ARCHIVED              | updated_at DESC       |

Pagination and search still apply: `page`, `pageSize`, `search`, `from`, `to`.

### Environment variables

At minimum configure:

- `PORT` – HTTP port (defaults to `4000`).
- `DATABASE_URL` – full PostgreSQL connection string _or_:
  - `DB_HOST`
  - `DB_PORT`
  - `DB_USER`
  - `DB_PASSWORD`
  - `DB_NAME` (defaults to `milkshop_backend`).
- `GMAIL_USER` – Gmail address used to send franchise confirmation emails.
- `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` – [Gmail App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) for that account (not your normal password). If unset, franchise form still works but no email is sent.
